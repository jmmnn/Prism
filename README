Lucid Prism - a user interface framework designed specifically for Apache Solr.

Current capabilities:
  * Direct Solr pass-through to the default LucidWorks Enterprise /lucid handler.
  
Prerequisites:

  * Launch LucidWorks Enterprise (currently hardcoded for LWE's collection1 core and /lucid request handler)

  * JRuby (using JRuby 1.5.6 for development), with Sinatra gem installed (jruby -S gem install sinatra)

Launching Prism:
  This is the very beginning of this project, with only a simple Solr response pass-thru action.

  Launch: jruby -rubygems -S prism.rb

  Browse: http://localhost:4567/search
    - all request parameters are simply passed through to LWE's default /lucid request handler at http://localhost:8888/solr/collection1

Known issues:
  * Parameter arrays don't work as they do with Solr
    /search?fq=one&fq=two only passes through one of the fq values.
    fq[] is the way to get arrays, so this works to pass through fq's to Solr: 
        /search?fq[]=one&fq[]=two
    We'll fix this lame one right away!
    
Features Roadmap:

  * LucidWorks Enterprise integration, including:
    - authorization
    - click logging
    - saved search alerts
  * Auto suggest
  * Auto search
  * User Interface viz goodies
    - SIMILE Timeline and Exhibit
    - Facet pie charts
    - Query overlap Venn diagrams
    - sparklines (if we must, for the Tuftee's among you)
    

Configuration:

  - TBD exactly, but the idea is to allow end users to simply configure Solr
    and add simple UI templates.
  - Convention over configuration?  Sort of, but less magic and
    more "just build the search UI intuitively".

FAQ
   Why?
     Because Solr search UI still isn't trivial enough to build for the
     masses.  We need something lean, clean, extensible, with all the modern
     day sparkly things built in.
     
   Why is it called Prism?
     Solr light shines through, pretty colors come out.
     
   Why JRuby?
     JRuby makes the Prism world a better place in a few ways -
       * Literally "run anywhere" without additional environmental impact;
         no need to install Ruby into your operating system.
       * Secret sauce: Velocity templating.  Opininated?  Sure.
         But for good reason*.  However, Prism itself will use any Ruby 
         templating technology you'd like.
       * Advanced users will likely enjoy being able to integrate Java code 
         for enterprisey things.

  How about non-(J)Ruby deployment?
     Deploying into another Ruby runtime shouldn't be a problem.  For the 
     moment, the development is proceeding with only JRuby and Velocity,
     but Prism is just a Sinatra Ruby app and can use ERb or other templating 
     technologies.
     
     If you want an ERb-based search UI for LucidWorks Enterprise, 
     there is one built directly into it.
     
     For other Ruby-based Solr search UI, consider starting with Blacklight
     or borrowing bits from Flare.
     
     For non-Ruby Solr search UI, there are many projects in a variety of 
     technologies floating out there.  Search around.
     
     For non-Solr search UI: Solr is a mighty fine search engine that you 
     should strongly consider, if only for this snazzy Prism search UI :)
     
  * Why Velocity?
     It's leaner, cleaner, and sports a number of powerful features that Prism 
     will leverage including dynamically controlled template loaders and 
     macros.  A basic comparison of Velocity versus ERb: 
     $var versus <%=@var%>.  Less typing, less junk, easier to document, no 
     Ruby or Java knowledge necessary.  We'll likely bring in Velocity through
     the Velaro (https://github.com/erikhatcher/velaro) project, and fleshing 
     out the JRuby/Velocity integration there.
