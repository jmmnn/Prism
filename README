Lucid Prism - a user interface framework designed specifically for Apache Solr, with extended features such as LucidWorks Enterprise click logging, authorization, and saves searches/alerts.

-----
Prerequisites:

  * Launch LucidWorks Enterprise (currently hardcoded for LWE's collection1 core and /lucid request handler)
  
  * JRuby (using JRuby 1.5.6 for development), with Sinatra gem installed (jruby -S gem install sinatra)

Launching Prism:
   This is the very beginning of this project, with only a simple Solr response pass-thru action.
   
   Launch: jruby -rubygems -S prism.rb
   
   Browse: http://localhost:4567/search - all request parameters are simply passed through to LWE's /lucid request handler.
